apt2sfs is a gui application using yad as frontend to create a module from downloaded files by apt-get.
To use it choose a drive for the working directory to be created and type name(s) of package(s).
The package(s) will be downloaded only (not installed!) along with the dependencies.
The deb packages will be extracted in a directory named after the chosen packages before squashfs module is created.
This means that the packages are NOT regularly installed and therefore are not registered by dpkg.
This has advantages and disadvantages
Advantages:
- dpkg cannot be broken because it knows nothing at all about these packages.
- the module can be loaded on the fly, almost without making any changes to the base system.
  (except for possibly leaving behind some files in $HOME/.config)

Disadvantages:
- Some applications may not work because e.g. depending on startup at boot or special postinstall script to run.
- Dependencies may not be all satisfied, therefore it is recommended to create the module with an empty save file so that apt "knows" about what dependencies are required from a basic DebianDog.(this will result to get larger size of module but gives more guarantee to work as expected). 
-----------------------------
loadmodule is a script that will load the module "on the fly"
This incuded loadmodule is for DebianDog (live-rw boot method).
For Porteus-Wheezy you can use the right-click option in Thunar ((de)activate module)
Note that a module can be acivated only from an "actual" mounted storage like /mnt/sda1 (so activating from e.g. /root or /tmp doesn't work).
 
Usage:
loadmodule -a /path/to/module.squashfs # will activate module
NOTE: A restart of X is needed to e.g. show application in menu.

loadmodule -d /path/to/module.squashfs # will deactivate module.

Update from previous loadmodule script (as also used in Sergey's sfs load application)
- Now full path of module can be used.
- Improved error checking (and yad messages)
