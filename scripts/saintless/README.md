These Scripts belong to [Saintless](http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=33288)

They are located [here](http://smokey01.com/saintless/source-code/), however I made a backup of some of them to use as reference for my own scripts just in case they disappear.

To the Author:
Feel free to contact me in case you want them to be removed
